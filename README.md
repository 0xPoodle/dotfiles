# dotfiles

Hey, these are the dotfiles I use daily! I donâ€™t have a ton of time to work on them, but I update this repo every time I tweak my real rig, so rest assured they're up to date.

I'm currently running Debian with i3wm, and while I haven't included all the packages I eventually want, maybe one day these might be usable as your daily driver, too! Use at your own risk...

Contributions, suggestions, and tips are welcome!
